As a Computer Science student, I often deal with messy, unstructured lecture notes. This application utilizes the OpenAI API to automatically process raw text input and convert it into structured, easy-to-read study summaries in real-time.

It demonstrates the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into a user-friendly frontend built with Python and Streamlit.

This application requires an OpenAI API key to function. The key is entered by the user in the sidebar and is only used for the duration of the session. It is not stored in any database or log file.
